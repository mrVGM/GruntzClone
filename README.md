# Gruntz Clone

This is an attempt to recreate (rather create some similar to) an old game I was playing in the past. It is called Gruntz and was released by *Monolith Productions* in the year of 1999.

My game includes some of the core features of the original one, which are showcased in few puzzle levels. I used the Unity 2020.3.25f1, to develop it. There is a WebGL build of the game, which you can try [here](https://mrvgm.github.io/GruntzClone/Build/v6/).
